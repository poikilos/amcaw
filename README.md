DISCLAIMER: Freakstritch is responsible for the name and design of the
original versions of the mobs which this document cites, and later
reboots (such as 22i's continuation of the GPL reboot)
or forks of 22i's reboot (such as Poikilos' variable-framerate Minetest
fork) may or may not approve of the names/mobs nor redistribute certain
mobs as described or named upstream.

I found this set of mobs in an incomplete state, with many mobs being
off scale. I will add Lua code to show the scale and other variables for
Minetest in each mob's section below, which will also mark the mob as
usable.

22i's Minetest-ready exported versions (plus alternate textures) are at
<https://github.com/22i/amcaw>.

-Poikilos

## Exporting

1. Join the mesh objects--you can't join every kind of object, so you can't
just do select all, but you can select one manually then do: Shift-G,
then click "Type" (shortcut for Select, Grouped, Type)--that will select
all Mesh objects--all parts of the body in this case.
2. Then do Ctrl-J (all body parts should now be light orange, whereas
before doing so, some where dark orange--selected but separate and not
active).
3. Export.

They are aggressive mobs that roam around around desert biomes. They
spit fireballs if they see the player from more then 10-30 blocks
(metres) away. They usually spawn in groups of 1-4. They come in a
variety of 5 colours; red, blue, green, yellow and brown.

## [DigBug](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/DigBug)
DigBug is a neutral mob that digs holes into the terrain as a trap for
the innocent Bubblescum. A curious side effect of digested Bubblescum
meat to DigBug is an exploding fountain of delicious cookies! DigBugs
can mine minerals such as Coal and Iron ore. However, the player has to
smelt the mineral.

<img src="http://imgur.com/bPMzKBz.png" width="150">

## [Discomole](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/discomole)
(not in original)

your ores, because these little thieves will steal them.

<img src="http://imgur.com/l3tRKX8.png" width="150">

## [Floob Ship](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/Floob Ship)
Floob Ships are mobs that have the special ability to spawn floobs. It
is quite large in size and is radioactive, it is best to avoid getting
close to these mobs since they cause damage to the player. Floob Ships
have 70 HP. Once a Floob Ship spawns, it will ascend to elevation 150
(which is above the map) at top speed. Once it reaches that height, the
Floob Ship will slowly descend down towards the surface. Once it lands,
it will begin to spit out Floobs that will attempt to vaporize the
player. It usually remains still unless the player or a Floob
accidentally hits it. A Floob Ship will explode once it is terminated,
which will kill the player instantly if he or she is too close.

<img src="http://imgur.com/RX4xmiJ.png" width="150">

## [Floob](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/floob)
Floob is an aggressive mob that drops RayGuns and is closely related to
the mob known as the Floob Ship. They are rather popular due to their
mysterious yet amusing behaviour. They have 12 HP and are difficult to
kill most of the time.

## [G](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/g)
G (also known as Letter G) is an aggressive mob that drops items that
start with the letter G. He is rather big in size and speaks in an
enigmatic manner. He is quite widely known due to his appearance.

<img src="http://imgur.com/fuR4mq8.png" width="150">

### Minetest
I selected the Armature, and the yellow lines show the keyframes in the
timeline. Clicking on different bones in pose mode will show different
keyframes, but using a dopesheet panel will show everything (there is a
dopesheet panel open in that blend file, but it is zoomed way out for
some reason). By dragging across the timeline, I determined the velocity
and sequences:
```Lua
    visual_size = {x = 10, y = 10},
    walk_velocity = 1.89,  -- 1.41918 / (6/8)
    run_velocity = 3.78,
    animation = {
        speed_normal = 8 ,
        walk_start = 0 ,
        walk_end = 15 ,
        walk_speed = 8 ,
        run_start = 0 ,
        run_end = 15 ,
        run_speed = 16 ,
        stand_start = 16 ,
        stand_end = 19,
        stand_speed = 2 ,
    } ,
```



## [Goo Goat](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/Goo_Goat)
The Goo Goat is a neutral mob that consists of goo and looks somewhat
similar to the Slime mob. They act in a similar manner to Blorps since
Goo Goats consume grass to grow while Blorps consume Leaves to grow. Goo
Goats drop 0-6 Goo Donuts upon death depending on their size.

<img src="http://imgur.com/u7ywzYG.png" width="150">

## [Growbot Gregg](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/growbotgregg)
He is an aggressive mob that zaps everything he seas with his growray
making everything bigger. Everytime gregg enlarges a mob, that mob
becomes stronger, so kill Gregg first.

<img src="http://imgur.com/BUFGeE4.png" width="150">

## [Guinea Pig](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/Guinea_Pig)
They will follow you around on your adventures if you feed them enough
red apples or wheat. Red apples are much more effective than wheat.
Golden apples automatically tame them. If you tame them, they will fight
(and die) for you. Each guinea pig has its own name and unique
personality, and will tell you when it is wounded. Feeding it more
apples or wheat will heal your pigs. If your guinea pig dies, it will
spawn a tombstone that tells you a bit about them. If you buy a [[Life
Gem]] from [[Sneaky Sal]], you can use this to bring guinea pigs back to
life!

<img src="http://imgur.com/5fNvqT1.png" width="150">

## [Hippo](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/hippo)
They are mostly seen in water, especially in Ocean and Swamp biomes.
They act like the passive in-game mobs.

## [Hotdog](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/Hotdog)

<img src="http://imgur.com/SXS8NBN.png" width="150">

### Minetest:
```Lua
    visual_size = {x = 10, y = 10},
    walk_velocity = 0.63,  -- 0.117807 per (6/32) sec = 0.628304
    run_velocity = 1.26,
    animation = {
        speed_normal = 32 ,
        walk_start = 0 ,

        stand_start = 16 ,
        stand_end = 20 ,
        stand_speed = 2 ,
    } ,
```

## [Hunchback](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/Hunchback)
The Hunchback will wander around the terrain, desperate for somebody to
hand him some Cake. If the Hunchback is provoked, it will charge at the
player furiously. Outrunning a Hunchback is very difficult due to his
insane speed. The best way to escape him is by heading towards water,
since Hunchbacks will still follow you but they will slow down, making
it easy for the player to swim away. The Hunchback can be tamed with
Cake. Once he is tamed, he will fight off enemies for the player and
follow the player everywhere. He cannot teleport to the player which can
be a problem. If the player gives their tamed Hunchback a Bone then it
will summon five Hunchback Skeletons. These Skeletons will then fight
for you by shooting arrows at the opponent. Hunchback Skeletons will
disintergrate after about one minute.

fine will reset.

Loliman is a neutral mob that is in search of the Kid. He supplies many
treats if the player does manage to reunite the kid with the Lolliman.
Once the Kid is reunited with the Lolliman, he will take off into the
atmosphere, never to be seen again. However, sometimes the Lolliman may
explode instead, so beware.

## [Pony](http://morecreepsandweirdos.wikia.com/wiki/pony)
Pony is tameable by giving the pony girl a cell phone and paying her
50 dollars. Once you have done those things, the Ponycloud will deliver
your pony. They start off really small, the size of an ant, and grow
when fed wheat, sweets (e.g. cake, cookies, lollipop, etc) and water. A
pony is very needy and if you do not watch it, your pony may get sick
and die (unless you give it medicine). You may also give your pony armor
(diamond boots are recommended), ride your pony off into the sunset,
enjoy the day adventuring, or have it help you fight your dangerous
mobs.

## Developer Notes
(Poikilos fork's notes on 22i's upstream version)

### Scale
The scaling seems weird (for example, lawyer is 5 meters tall, which
doesn't make sense at any known scale--its as if they are using units as
feet and he is short, so I suppose convert feet to meters (0.3048) for
the lawyer. So use 0.3048 * 10 (see list below)--you would multiply
velocity by that to match if you manually calculate velocity in Blender)
so perhaps others also have scaling issues. Recommended scaling:
```
visual_scale = {x = 1.0, y = 1.0}  -- blorp
visual_scale = {x = 10, y = 10}  -- (objects: floob_ship, slot_machine, tombstone), bubblescum, castle_critter, g, rocketgirafe
visual_scale = {x = 22.5, y = 22.5}  -- big baby ({x = 2.25, y = 2.25} would be regular baby)
visual_scale = {x = 4, y = 4}  -- camel
visual_scale = {x = 7.5, y = 7.5}  -- hippo
visual_scale = {x = 8.5, y = 8.5}  -- bull

The robots and several others in the (proprietary version's) screenshots
are extremely tall...the "all rights reserved" version (not included)
seems to have several huge mobs, but he (freakstritch) was probably just
not paying attention. The reboot seems to follow the same strange
scale (or follow the lack of any predetermined scale). Maybe just
convert feet to meters for g.blend as well. You'd have to scale the
velocity values by .305 if you use visual_size 3.05, since the original
values assume 10 as the visual_size (to convert feet to meters:
1/3.28084 = ~0.305). I'm working on changing the scale to real life
scale (meters), so that scale can be set to 10 in Minetest.
